<h1>Graph-RAT Overview</h1>
<p>Graph-RAT is unique in the way that it unifies a number of different analysis
techniques and methods into a single high-level analysis language. 
The graph consists of three distinct levels of abstraction. The lowest level is
the data structure. The next higher level of abstraction is the graph-view tree.
The final level of abstraction is the algorithm pipe.
</p>
<h2>Data Structure</h2>
<p>The building blocks of graphs are properties. Each property is a (possibly multivalued)
variable that contains a Java object. Every property exists within a
context. This context is defined by vertices (actors) and edges (links). Each
vertices has a class (mode) as does each edge (a relation). Graphs themselves
can also have typed properties. Any Java class is an acceptable property type,
provided the appropriate serialization routines are provided. A collection of
actors and links are collected within a graph, indexing them.</p>
<p>Actors are created using an ActorFactory singleton which uses a java.util.Properties
object to specify the parameters to create the Actor. See the Javadoc of Actor-
Factory for a list of all actor types, their properties, and what these properties
influence. Likewise, Links are created from a LinkFactory, and Graphs from a
GraphFactory.</p>
<h3>View Tree</h3>
<p>The set of all actors and links form the root view of a graph. All graphs can
have an arbitrary number of child graphs which contain a strict subset of the
root graph’s actors and links. This forms an acyclic hierarchy of subsets of the
original data in the form of a B-Tree. This tree can be queried using a regular
expression for which the set of closest-to-root graphs whose ID matches the
expression is returned.</p>
<p>Subgraphs are either created manually by adding existing actors and links
to a new graph object or by use of the getSubGraph() method of the Graph
interface. Once actors and links are added, the graph can be listed as a child
of a graph by registering it with the addChild() method of the Graph interface.
Similarly, getSubGraph creates a graph which can be added with the addChild()
method.</p>
<h3>Language Structure</h3>
<p>A Graph-RAT program consists of three components: A graph declaration,
a sequence of data acquisition modules, and a sequence of algorithm—view
expression pairs.</p>
<p>The graph declaration that determines which graph implementation will be
used during execution. The parameters are fed to a factory which generates
the base graph of the given type. For SQL-backed graphs, this may load a
pre-existing graph without data acquisition modules.</p>
<p>The next component is a sequence of data acquisition algorithms that add
properties to the graph. Each data acquisition algorithm entry must have a
unique ID and is executed sequentially using the parameters provided.
The third component is a sequence of view expression—algorithm pairs.
For each pair, the expression is used to obtain a sequence of graphs. The
given algorithm is then executed with each graph sequentially using the declared
parameters. Missing parameters are filled with the default value.</p>
<h2>Algorithm Types</h2>
<p>Graph-RAT algorithms can be divided into three primary types—propositional
algorithms, clustering algorithms, and analytical algorithms.</p>
<p>The most basic building block algorithms are the propositional algorithms.
These algorithms transform properties into weka Instance objects and move
these properties into different parts of the graph using aggregator functions.
Ultimately, one can propositionalize the entire data set using only these methods.</p>
<p>Clustering algorithms take a given set and alter the graph view tree based
on the content of the data. The only properties created during this process are
those that declare the graph ID of the new sub-tree an actor or link has been
assigned to.</p>
<p>Analytical algorithms take a set of graph data and construct new actors or
links which are added back to the graph. These algorithms include link-based
analysis such as prestige analysis and actor based analysis such as machinelearning
algorithms.</p>
