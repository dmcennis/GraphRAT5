<h1>Graph-RAT 0.4 Users Guide</h1>
<p>Graph-RAT is a powerful language for performing data analysis.  Its speciality is 
mixing traditional analysis of social networks and traditional machine learning.
As a result, there exists a number of algorithms implemented from sociology, graph theory, and 
machine learning.  This guide will outline how to construct applications in this
framework to solve real world problems.</p>
<p>First, one should read the <a href="overview.html">overview of Graph-RAT</a> to understand
this rather unusual environment</p>
<p>Next, in constructing applications, there are three sets of choices to make: how to get the data, what type of graph 
object to use with the data, and what algorithms to execute over the data.</p>

<li><a href="algorithm/index.html">Algorithms</a>Overview of what algorithms are and how to combine them.</li>
</ul>
<p>For reference, all algorithm descriptions and a number of sample Graph-RAT programs are also provided.</p>
