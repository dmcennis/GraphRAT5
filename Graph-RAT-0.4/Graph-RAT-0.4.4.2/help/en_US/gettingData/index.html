<h1>Getting Data</h1>
There are three different ways to get data into Graph-RAT for analysis.  One is to use
the WebCrawler.  Another is to create an XML file.  The final way is to construct 
a Graph-RAT database.

<ul>
<li><a href="crawl.html">Webcrawling</a>: <a href="">CrawlLiveJournal</a> provides a ready-made algorithm for this purpose,
crawling the blog site LiveJournal for FOAF user descriptions.</li>
<li><a href="XML.html">Graph-RAT XML</a>: Construct an xml file outside Graph-RAT conforming
to the Graph-RAT's MemGraph's XML format for loading a graph.</li>
<li><a href="database.html">Graph-RAT DB</a>: Construct a database that conforms to DarbyDB's
or PostgresqlDB's syntax, then load the graph using a custom <a href="../graphTypes/index.html">graph type</a>.</li>
