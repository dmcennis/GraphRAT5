<h1>Crawling using CrawlLiveJournal</h1>
<p>
CrawlLiveJournal is the easiest to use.  Download a FOAF page from Livejournal.
Any journal will do.  The pages are located at 'http://<username>.livejournal.com/data/foaf'
Add CrawlLivejournal without any algorithms.  Edit CrawlLiveJournal:</p>

<p>Unless you are behind a proxy, the only change needed is to set the directory to
find your seed foaf file under 'foafDirectory'.  Other than changing the stop
count to a different value, there is nothing else that needs to be changed.
</p>
<p>After the process is finished, use FileReader2Pass to read the files into memory.</p>

<p>Once again, the foaf directory is the only parameter than needs to be changed to match the
directory created earlier.  Now you have a MemGraph loaded into memory ready for analysis.</p>
