<h1>Data Aquisition Glossary</h1>
<p>Data Acquisition modules have no inputs and lots of outputs types. Each 
algorithm is designed to be run first as the start of an algorithm sequence.  
These are the only class that routinely uses I/O to collect information form the 
graph.  This is typically a file, the Internet, or a database.  The outputs vary 
widely both in number and in type.  At a minimum, a set of modes (Actor types), 
relations (Link types), and Actor Properties (Properties attached to a specific 
mode of actor) are defined.  Sometimes sub-graphs are defined as well.  Only one 
data acquisition module can be run for each algorithm sequence.
