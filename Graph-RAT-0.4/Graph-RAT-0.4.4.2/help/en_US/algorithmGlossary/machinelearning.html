<h1>Machine Learning Glossary</h1>
<p>Often, one has data about something, a selected few have ‘ground truth’ – 
known true classifications of one actor to another actor type (such as plants to 
known species types).  One would like to have the computer figure out what data 
implies what classification to the other actor type.  Graph-RAT uses the Weka 
machine learning package for this.  One version is for traditional machine 
learning.  The other is for multiple instance machine learning (where multiple 
data are associated with a single actor.)
