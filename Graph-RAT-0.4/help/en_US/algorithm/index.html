<h1>Algorithms</h1>
<p>Algorithms execute over a set of graphs.  For each graph, algorithms execute 
over actor modes and link relations.  Modes are usually nouns describing all 
actors of a particular class such as artists, songs, and users.  Relations are 
usually verbs describing classes of relationships between actors such as 
ListensTo, Wrote, or Friend.  These are set as parameters.
</p>
<p>
The example is the PageRank algorithm using parameter mode set to ‘User’, 
parameter relation set to ‘Friend’, and output parameter set to ‘prestige’

One then chains algorithm by choosing as the input the output created by an 
earlier algorithm.  In this example, an algorithm, such as AggregateByLink, 
will use the Property prestige created on actors of mode ‘User’ to perform more 
calculations such as creating a Weka Instance in preperation for using machine 
learning to predict more ListensTo relations.</p>
