<h1>Collaborative Filtering Glossary</h1>
<p>Collaborative Filtering algorithms work from two modes and relation between 
them.  They then add a new relation predicting by co-occurrence whether or not a 
new link should be defined between two points.  There are three types of 
collaborative filtering: associative, item-to-item, and user-to-user.  All three 
variations have been implemented and are provided in this group of algorithms.
