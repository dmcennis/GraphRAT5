<h1>Clustering Glossary</h1>
<p>Clustering algorithms take a graph as input and then create sub-graphs based 
on the pattern of actors and links in the graph.  Frequently, clustering 
considers only actors of a specific mode and links of a specific relation.  
These algorithms are incredibly powerful as later algorithms can select to run 
over previously created sub-graphs, then use aggregation to create cluster 
properties on each actor, eventually using cluster-specific properties to create 
sections of a Weka machine learning instance used in a machine learning algorithm.
